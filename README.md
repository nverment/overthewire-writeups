# overthewire-writeups

writeups for some overthewire modules i completed so far. currently working on the bandit writeup, as well as the narnia and natas wargames (writeups will come after i finish them).

modules so far:
- [x] bandit
- [ ] natas (in progress)
- [x] leviathan
- [x] krypton
- [ ] narnia (in progress)

writeups so far:
- [ ] bandit (in progress)

note: i strongly suggest against using any sort of guidance or writeups before you completely exhaust every possibility in each level of the wargames. my writeups exist as notes to myself, and as proof that i completed the above challenges - and hopefully as some extra insight for whoever stumbles upon them. the best way to learn is by failing :)
